# part2
6. There are eight 1bit full adder integrated circuits. Combine them to 8bit adder circuit using the following box diagram.
7. Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. Such as(X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2 = (0000X4X3X2X1)2 We called that (00001111)2 is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work. Fill the follow expression 
    1. (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = ( )2
    1. (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 xor (00001111)2 = ( )2
    1. ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (11110000)2 ) or (not (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2
    ) = ( )2

# Part3
## Logic gate
A logic gate is an idealized or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.

## Boolean algebra
In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0, respectively.
